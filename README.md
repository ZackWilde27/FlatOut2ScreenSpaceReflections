# FlatOut 2 Screen-Space Reflections

This is a remake of Chloe's SSR mod for FlatOut 2, using Reloaded

## Using

First, put ```SSR.dll``` and ```SSRShader.bfs``` in the game's folder, next to ```FlatOut2.exe```

Then, add ```SSRShader.bfs``` on it's own line in the ```patch``` file

## Compiling
I used Visual Studio 2022 on Windows

You'll need my fork of Sewer's FlatOut 2 SDK, as well as the Direct X SDK to get ```d3d9.h```
